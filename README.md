## Project 2: Implementing CQRS & Event Sourcing with Kafka in .NET
### Requirements
- Some experience with C# is essential

### Description
This project focuses on creating .NET microservices that adhere to the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing patterns using Apache Kafka. Participants will learn to write every line of code needed to build their own CQRS and Event Sourcing framework. The project aims to equip learners with the skills to handle commands, raise events, and implement various advanced features like event versioning and optimistic concurrency control.

### Key Learning Outcomes
- Handling commands and raising events
- Implementing command and query dispatchers using the mediator pattern
- Creating and changing aggregate states with event messages
- Implementing event stores and read databases with MongoDB and MS SQL
- Producing and consuming events with Apache Kafka
- Replaying event stores to recreate state and databases
- Applying Domain-Driven Design best practices

## Project 3: Mastering RabbitMQ: Messaging Concepts and Implementation
### Requirements
- C# knowledge only for coding lessons

### Description
This project provides an in-depth look at RabbitMQ and general messaging concepts. It covers the basics of message brokers and dives into the specific components and usage scenarios of RabbitMQ. The course includes practical demos and coding lessons in C# and Java, illustrating how to implement common messaging scenarios. It also explores the management web interface for testing RabbitMQ systems.

### Key Learning Outcomes
- Understanding RabbitMQ and its components
- Learning to configure and use RabbitMQ
- Implementing messaging scenarios using C# and Java
- Utilizing the RabbitMQ management web interface

## Project 4: Advanced RabbitMQ: Practical Implementation and Best Practices
### Requirements
